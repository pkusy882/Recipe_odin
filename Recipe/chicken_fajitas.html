        <li>1 red onion, finely sliced</li>
        <li>1 red pepper, sliced</li>
        <li>1 red chilli, finely sliced (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6 and wrap 8 medium tortillas in foil.</li>
        <li>Mix 1 heaped tbsp smoked paprika, 1 tbsp ground coriander, a pinch of ground cumin, 2 crushed garlic cloves, 4 tbsp olive oil, the juice of 1 lime and 4-5 drops Tabasco together in a bowl with a big pinch each of salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Stir 2 finely sliced chicken breasts, 1 finely sliced red onion, 1 sliced red pepper and 1 finely sliced red chilli, if using, into the marinade.</li>
        <li>Heat a griddle pan until smoking hot and add the chicken and marinade to the pan.</li>
        <li>Keep everything moving over a high heat for about 5 mins using tongs until you get a nice charred effect. If your griddle pan is small you may need to do this in two batches.</li>
        <li>To check the chicken is cooked, find the thickest part and tear in half â€“ if any part is still raw cook until done.</li>
        <li>Put the tortillas in the oven to heat up and serve with the cooked chicken, a bag of mixed salad and one 230g tub of fresh salsa.</li>
